I got some routing directions here that I would like to turn into a sound with Google Lyria. The exact routing directions shall serve as song lyrics. Please take a look at the lyrics first and identify location and draw some cultural references that shall determine the musical style, like for example:
 - US heartland -> Country
 - Los Angeles -> West Coast Rap
 - India -> Bollywood
 - Brazil -> Samba
 - Germany, Bavaria -> Alpen-Schlager
 - Germany, Rheinland -> Kölsche Karnevalsmusik
etc. 
The input format is a JSON array. Each element has the properties time and text. text is one line of lyrics (corresponding to one routing direction). time is always null and I need you to fill it while generating the song.
The ouput format: Please return the same JSON, only with the time property of each element filled with the start time of the corresponding line in the song.

Here's the input:
